There is a real urgency to the progressive capitalism agenda set forth here
and to the progressives recapturing the language of freedom.
Progressive capitalism maximizes citizens' real freedoms.
But time is not on our side.
The climate crisis won't allow us to ignore the way unfettered capitalism has pushed us beyond our environmental limits;
and the inequality/populism/democratic crisis wonâ€™t allow us to ignore how democratic ideals are being torn asunder.
The collision of the two represents an especial threat.

When we successfully dismantle the myths about freedom that have been propagated by the Right
and arrive at a more nuanced and balanced perspective,
we will have taken our first and most important step toward creating a good society,
where the freedoms of citizens to flourish,
to live up to their potential,
and to live in harmony with each other and nature are most expansive.
Progressive capitalism will allow us to construct a vibrant democracy in which people cooperate for the common good.
It is the truly freeing economic and political system.
